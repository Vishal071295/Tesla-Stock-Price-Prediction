# Tesla-Stock-Price-Prediction

Create a predictive DL model to predict the stock price of Tesla with following key
points -
● Deep Learning Models:
○ Stock Price data is sequential in nature and as you know Recurrent
Neural Networks have worked very well on Sequential Data. Hence,
explore deep learning approaches like Recurrent Neural Networks
(RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks for the data and
compare the performance.
○ You have to perform the analysis on the closing price. We are expecting
you to create deep learning models (SimpleRNN and LSTM) that can
predict 1 day, 5 days and 10 days behaviour of stock’s closing price
○ Analyze and handle missing values in the dataset (if any). How would
you handle them differently for training the model having a time
component in it ?
○ Use GridSearchCV to tune hyperparameters like the number of LSTM
units, dropout rate, and learning rate.
